# Data-Science
Welcome to my Data Science projects,. Here I attached my submission, course exercises, and my other data-related works.
1. Convolutional Neural Network: Image recognition for hand showing Rock/Paper/Scissors. (Submission Project for Dicoding: "Machine Learning for Beginner/Belajar Machine Learning Untuk Pemula"), as a required project to pass the course.
2. Natural Language Processing: Emotion in Text (dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/ishantjuyal/emotions-in-text).
3. Time Series: Hourly Energy Consumption (dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption?select=FE_hourly.csv)
4. Image Classification Model Deployment (to TFLite).
5. Project Machine Learning: Building Recommender System (IMBD Weighted Ratings Formula).
